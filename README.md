## 1.Team members:  
     Shi Yingbo 19023254   Zhang Jing 19023271  
     
## 2.instructions on how to run our program:  
     To run our code,on the Jtatext.java with other .java files so we can build the text editor having a menu of five different options   
     at the top of the editor.  
     Then we can click these choices lists under these five buttoms to do different operations.  
     We can also test the open,save and search functions with JUnit in the GuiTest.java file. 
     And it can make reports using PMD.
     
     ### The folder:  
     Our code have some floders like src,reports,target and others. 
     
     The src has Jtatext.java,Replace.java,AboutBook.java,LookHelp.java,Print.java,GuiTest.java these files.  
     The Replace.java file is linked with "Replace" buttom.  
     The AboutBook.java file is llinked with "About" buttom.  
     The LookHelp.java file is linked with "Help" buttom.
     The Print.java file is linked with "Print" buttom.  
     The GuiTest.java file is linked with "Open","Save","Search" buttoms.
     
     The reports floder includes the right report by PMD.  
     The reports is also made automatically.  
     
     The target floder is made automatically.  
     
 ## 3.The branches:  
     We both have a branch to push our own documents to update continuously and finally merge to the master.  
     Our Github IDs are shiyingbo4869 and ZHANG776923.  
     And the master is made by shiyingbo4869.  
     
 ## 4.Some features that are worthy to mention:  
     We can print text saved as PDF format using our "Print" function connected with local printer.  
     The Time and Date (T&D)is used to retrieve the current time and data and place it in the top of the page of the editor.   
     We can read source code files like .java files,.py files and other types of files like .pp files.  
     Different syntax can be put up in different colors through the text editor.  
     Successful reports can be made by the PMD.  
     JASON files can be used to transform the files to different structures.
